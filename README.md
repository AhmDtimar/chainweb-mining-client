A mining client for Kadena Chainweb. It supports

* multi threaded CPU mining,
* external mining workers (e.g. a GPU),
* simulated mining for testing.

Competitive mining on the Kadena Chainweb Mainnet requires special mining
hardware, which usually comes with its own mining client and mining pool
support implementations. This generic mining client is intended mostly for
testing.
